## Overview

With this project I wanted to consolidate try a larger project and make use of CSS grid a bit more to get comfortable with it.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I use the mobile first approach. I focused on the typography first.

I struggled with the SVG images, for some reason the fill property wasn't working. I haven't figured out why.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JS for the menu
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to do the mobile menu, it was my first one from scratch.

It was a good practice on grid and responsiveness on a full landing page.
