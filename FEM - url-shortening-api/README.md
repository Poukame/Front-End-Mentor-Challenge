## Overview

With this project I wanted to challenge myself with React and async API call.
Despite an issue that blocked me for a while I have managed to complete this project.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

I use the mobile first approach and did the mobile then the desktop layout before anything else.

Then I focused on the interactivity part with React. The part that gave me a hard time was to trigger a render to display the link after the click AND the fetch.

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about the React logic. As I was reading and learning about it as part of my learning I got new knowledge and would probably not struture this project the way I did.

Knowledge for a future project :)
