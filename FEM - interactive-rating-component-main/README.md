## Overview

This is my 1st project on Front-End mentor. I wanted to consolidate my use of flexbox before starting to learn grid.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

Very interesting challenge.
The design itself is ok. The challenge was in the active states and interactivity in the Javascript.
I learned to use querySelectorAll in combination with forEach loop to quickly assign eventListener or class.
