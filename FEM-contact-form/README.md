- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I chose this project for discovering Formik for React which I had never used before and also to practice a bit more Tailwind CSS.

I could have done it quicker with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS but I wanted to spend time in the documentation in order to learn new things.

I've added the first name on confirm toast, fetched from Formik.

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Formik and Yup
- Mobile-first workflow
