# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Notes

I dont't know why but I misunderstood the project. I thought there was 4 product instead of one. When I realized I had already built most of the logic and decided to keep it that way.
Therefore I created a data file with mock data to pretend there are 4 products.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
